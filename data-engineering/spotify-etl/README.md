## Introduction
This implements a data pipeline on Spotify's Recently Played tracks. The data is downloaded through Spotify API and is saved in SQLite database.

Spotify API token is generated from https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/.

This pipeline is scheduled to run daily using Airflow.
