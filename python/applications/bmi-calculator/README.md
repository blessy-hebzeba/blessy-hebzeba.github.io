## Introduction

This project creates a BMI calculator. It takes in the height and weight and calculate the BMI. Also, it says whether the BMI falls within the normal range or not.

## Setting Up

- Step 2: Once the Submit button is hit, the program returns the BMI and the range within which the value falls in.
- Step 3: A new button appears for calculating again or another BMI.
